<Card title="What does crate2nix do?">
`crate2nix` builds your [cargo](https://crates.io/)-based [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) project 
crate-by-crate with [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/).

You can 

* save time by only rebuilding changed crates hermetically in CI, and
* use `cargo`/`rust-analyzer` locally for a fast developing loop.

**Dependency tree from cargo**: It uses [cargo_metadata](https://github.com/oli-obk/cargo_metadata) to obtain the
dependency tree from cargo. Therefore, it will use the exact same library versions as cargo and respect any locked down
version in `Cargo.lock`.

**Smart caching**: It caches the builds of individual creates so that nix rebuilds exactly the crates that need to be rebuilt.
Compare that to docker layers...

**Nix ecosystem goodness**: You can use all things that make the nix/NixOS ecosystem great, e.g. distributed/remote builds,
build minimal docker images, deploy your binary as a service to the cloud, ...

**Out of the box support for libraries with non-rust dependencies**: It builds on top of the `buildRustCrate`
function from [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) so that native dependencies of
many rust libraries are already correctly fetched when needed. If your library with native dependencies is not yet
supported, you can customize `defaultCrateOverrides` / `crateOverrides`, see below.

**Optional Import From Derivation**: Optional ability to generate the derived `Cargo.nix` during evaluation time so it does
no need to be committed.

**Easy to understand nix template**: The actual nix code is generated via `crate2nix/templates/build.nix.tera` so you can
fix/improve the nix code without knowing rust if all the data is already there.
